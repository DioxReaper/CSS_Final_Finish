                <p>User-interfaced marketplaces like Facebook Marketplace pose several risks for buyers and sellers due to their peer-to-peer nature. 
                These platforms often lack comprehensive oversight, making it easier for scammers to exploit users with fraudulent listings, fake products, or non-delivery after payment. 
                Thereâ€™s also the risk of receiving counterfeit or stolen goods. Furthermore, personal safety can be a concern when meeting strangers to complete transactions, especially if the meet-up location is not secure. 
                Without the protections offered by more regulated e-commerce platforms, disputes over payments or product quality can also be harder to resolve.</p>
                <p>These are simple issues that are displayed and warned about by these marketplaces themselves and will always advocate for the buyers.
                Although this is the case there is not much you can do about it if you are scammed as it is still as user interfaced product.
                The market places do work on validating the product by making them meet a criteria that is necessary for the safety of all users, when this happens
                they will not take responisibility anything does happen such as recieving the incorrect product. </p>
