                <p>This is a project I Jacob Garcia has created to help inform and provide information about user based marketplaces.
                    The importants of this topic is that not many have experienced or is knowlegable about the topic and I want to spread the awareness
                    and dangers of these types of marketplaces. Futhermore I am not perse experienced and am always open to improving on this information
                    you can contact me at the contact page to help me improve on the topic more so than I already have!
